# Infrastructure as Code in Microsoft Azure

Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an important aspect of successful DevOps. In this workshop, long-time Microsoft MVP and MS Regional Director Rainer Stropek introduces you to IaC in Microsoft's Azure cloud. Instead of showing slides, Rainer will build an end-to-end sample with you. You will learn about the Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager (ARM), ARM Templates, and Azure-related GitHub Actions.

The sample that Rainer uses consists of a Single Page App (SPA) UI, multiple backend services, Azure SQL Databases, virtual networks with private endpoints, DNS zones, and many other things. So you can be sure that you learn IaC in Azure not just in a "Hello World" scenario, but based on a real-world example.

This workshop is particularly interesting for people who have basic DevOps skills and want to learn about IaC in Azure. Basic knowledge about cloud computing is required, but you do not need to be an Azure expert in order to participate in this workshop.

Rainer will show all demos live. You can join him if you have an Azure subscription in which you have administrative privileges. However, if you want to focus on learning the concepts, you can also just watch, make notes, and use the opportunity to ask Rainer questions. For following along with the demos, you additionally need the following software installed on your computer:

* A Linux environment (on Windows, you can use WSL 2) in which you have administrative privileges
* Azure CLI installed in your Linux environment
* Visual Studio Code with Azure-related extensions
* A Git client connected to a GitHub account
