# Azure ML Security

## Title

Title: *Network Security and Azure Machine Learning*

## Abstract

Data scientists need lots of precious data for their work. Therefore, protecting machine learning environments in the public cloud is important. In this session, long-time Azure MVP und Microsoft Regional Director Rainer Stropek demonstrates some of Azure's network security features in conjunction with Azure Machine Learning. Instead of describing the security functions theoretically, Rainer uses Azure-ML to show them in practice. You will see VNets, Private Endpoints, DNS Zones, Key Vaults, AAD Managed Identities, and secure SSH access to ML-related compute instances. This session is for people who think about using Azure-ML and for those generally interested in network security feature of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. You do not need to be a data scientist for this session.
