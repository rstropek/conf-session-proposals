## Abstract

In the past, organizations invested lots of time and money in perimeter security solutions that should keep bad people out of their corporate network. Inside, all were friends and security measurements not as strict. In the cloud, things have changed. Given the powerful PaaS platforms that modern cloud providers offer, it is possible to build and run enterprise applications in the public cloud and use the Internet as ones corporate network. In this session, Rainer Stropek talks about the principles of Zero Trust Networking. He will spend a large part of the talk building sample solutions in the Azure cloud speaking about what services Azure provides particularly in the context of Zero Trust Networking (e.g. VNets, AAD, Managed Identities, Private Endpoints, Managed Certificates, etc.).
