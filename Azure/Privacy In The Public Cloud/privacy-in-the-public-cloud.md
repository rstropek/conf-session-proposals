## Abstract

We all know that web APIs should be written in a way that they can be connected to the public internet. Proper encryption, authentication and authorization make them secure, they are the new firewall. In practice, this requirement isn't easy to fulfill. Code gets old, you do not always have the time to keep each line of code up to date. Formerly, things were much simpler. We ran applications in our local, private networks. Private networks are not perfectly secure, but they gave us an extra layer of protection. In Azure, private networks especially with PaaS have been possible, but expensive and hard to manage. Azure Private Endpoints are a game changer in that respect. They make PaaS resources on private networks simple to use and cost efficient. In this session Rainer uses an end-to-end demo to introduce Azure Private Endpoints in particular in conjunction with Azure Web Apps and Azure Storage.
