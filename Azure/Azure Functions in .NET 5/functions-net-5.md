# Azure Functions in .NET 5

It took a while until serverless Azure Functions could be developed using the latest and greatest version of .NET. In this session, Rainer Stropek demonstrates how you use .NET 5 to develop Azure Functions. As you will see, they are different in many ways from what you might already know from .NET Framework or .NET Core 3.1. Rainer assumes that you have good C# and .NET skills and at least basic knowledge about Azure. You do not need to be an Azure Functions expert for this session.
