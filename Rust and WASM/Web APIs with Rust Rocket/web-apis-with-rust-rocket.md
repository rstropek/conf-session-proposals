# Web APIs with Rust Rocket

## Title

*Web APIs with Rust Rocket*

## Abstract

Is Rust only relevant for systems programming? Do you need platforms like Go or Node.js to build great web APIs? Not really, Rust does a great job in this area, too. The speaker, Rainer Stropek, has been building cloud-based distributed systems for many years and is co-founder of the [Rust Linz meetup](https://rust-linz.at). In this session, he will give an introduction into Rust's [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) web framework and compares it to popular frameworks from other programming languages.
