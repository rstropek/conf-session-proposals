Title: *Securing ASP.NET Web APIs With Azure Active Directory*

## Abstract

Securing a web API is a common talk. It shouldn't be complicated. Luckily, it isn't if you can use an existing *Azure Active Directory* infrastructure. In this session, Rainer Stropek demonstrates how to secure ASP.NET web APIs with Microsoft's latest version of its *Identity Platform*. He introduces you to key API-related AAD terms, shows how to automate the necessary AAD- and Azure-configuration, demonstrates how to secure a given ASP.NET 5 web API with the corresponding packages, and closes by connecting an AAD-protected SPA (Angular).
