# Exploring Go for Microservices

## Title

*Exploring Go for Microservices*

## Abstract

### English

The programming language Go is growing in popularity. It promises microservices with a small footprint while still offering high developer productivity. This session is for developers who wonder whether they should consider Go for their next microservices project. Instead of showing slides, Rainer Stropek demonstrates the capabilities of Go by developing an end-to-end web API example. You will hear about the principles of the programming language, see router, data access, etc. in action, learn how to package the web API into an efficient Docker container, and see how we can run the container in the cloud. Rainer does not expect any deep prior knowledge of Go on your side. His session should raise interest and provide enough information so you can decide whether you want to dive deeper into the Go universe.
